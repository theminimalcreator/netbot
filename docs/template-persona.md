## 4. ❌ vs ✅ (Practical Examples)

*The best way to calibrate the AI or writer.*

| Context | ❌ DON'T WRITE LIKE THIS (Generic/Boring) | ✅ WRITE LIKE THIS (My Voice) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Giving an opinion** | "I believe this tool can be useful depending on the context." | "Honestly? This tool is like using a cannon to kill a fly. Nobody needs this." |
| **Teaching something** | "It is important to observe the retention metric to ensure success." | "Forget acquisition. If the bucket is leaking (low retention), you're just burning money." |
| **Celebrating** | "We are very happy with the result achieved by the team." | "We crushed it. The team was flying today. Pure pride." |
| **Talking about a mistake** | "We made an error in the planning." | "I messed up. I was naive in the planning and the bill arrived." |

## 5. 📺 Adaptation by Channel
